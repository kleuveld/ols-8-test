# Overview

This is a test repository on how to make pages based on small snippets.

The repository has GitHub pages enabled, meaning it will serve the index.html
page when you visit https://kleuveld.github.com/ols-8-test.

Index.md just contains links to the pages, which are in the /pages folder.

Pages can combine multiple items from the /items folder.

# How to update the website

1. Make changes to the page (the .rmd file) or item.
2. Render the .rmd file you changed to generate .md. If you've changed an item,
render all pages that use the item.
3. Commit the changes to the main branch.
4. Push the changes to github.com, and wait.
